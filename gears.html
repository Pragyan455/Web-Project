				<li><h4>Cricket Ball:</h4></li>

					<p>A cricket ball is a hard, solid ball used to play cricket. A cricket ball consists of a cork core wound with string then a leather cover stitched on, and manufacture is regulated by cricket law at first-class level. The trajectory of a cricket ball when bowled, through movement in the air, and off the ground, is influenced by the action of the bowler and the condition of the ball and the pitch, while working on the cricket ball to obtain optimal condition is a key role of the fielding side. The principle method through which the batsman scores runs is by hitting the ball, with the bat, into a position where it would be safe to take a run, or by directing the ball through or over the boundary. Cricket balls are harder and heavier than baseballs.</p>
				<li><h4>Cricket bat:</h4></li>

					<p>A cricket bat is a specialised piece of equipment used by a batsman in the sport of cricket to hit the ball, typically consisting of a cane handle attached to a flat-fronted willow-wood blade. it may also be used by a batter who is making their ground to avoid a run out, if they hold the bat and touch the ground with it. The length of a bat may be no more than 38 inches (965 mm) and the width no more than 4.25 inches (108 mm). Its use was first mentioned in 1624. Since 1979, a law change stipulated that bats can only be made from wood.</p>
				<li><h4>Wickets:</h4></li>
					<img src="image\wicket1.jpg" width="250px" height="250px"><img src="image\wicket2.jpg" width="250px" height="250px"><img src="image\wicket3.jpg" width="250px" height="250px">
					<p>It is one of the sets of three stumps and two bails at either end of the pitch. The fielding team's players can hit the wicket with the ball in a number of ways to get a batsman out.</p>
					<p>The wicket is guarded by a batsman who, with his bat (and sometimes with his paads, but considering the laws on LBW (leg before wicket), attempts to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket (if he does, he is bowled out) and to score runs where possible.</p>
					<p>Through metonymic usage, the dismissal of a batsman is known as the taking of the wicket.</p>
				<li><h4>Protective clothing/equipment:</h4></li>
					<img src="image\equipment1.jpg" width="250px" height="250px"><img src="image\equipment2.jpg" width="250px" height="250px"><img src="image\equipment3.jpg" width="250px" height="250px">
					<p>Cricket clothing and equipment is regulated by the laws of cricket. Cricket whites, sometimes called flannals, are the loose fitting clothes which are worn while playing cricket so as not to restrict the players's movement. Use of the protective equipment, such as cricket helmets, gloves and pads is also regulated.</p>
					
				<ul type="disc">
					<li>Collared shirt (white in tests domestic; as per team kit in one day formats[international]) with short or long sleeves depending on the climate or personal preference.</li>
					<li>Long trousers (white in tests and domestic; as per team kit in one day formats[international]).</li>
					<li>Jumper (a woollen pullover, if necessary). This is usually a vest.</li>
					<li>Sun hat, cricket cap or baseball cap.</li>
					<li>Spiked shoes to increase traction.</li>
					<li>Jockstrap with cup pocket into which a "box", or protective cup, is inserted and held in place.</li>
					<li>Abdominal guard or "box" or an L Guard for male batsmen and wicket-keepers (often referred to as a cup, box or abdo guard). It is usually constructed from high density plastic with a padded edge, shaped like a hollow half-pear, and inserted into the jockstrap with cup pocket underwear of the batsmen and wicket-keeper. This is used to protect the crotch area against impact from the ball.</li>
					<li>Helmet (often with a visor), worn by batsmen and fielders close to the batsman on strike to protect their heads.</li>
					<li>Leg pads, worn by the two batsmen and the wicket-keeper, used to protect the shin bone against impact from the ball. The wicket-keeping pads are slightly different from the batsmen's. Fielders that are fielding in close to the batsmen may wear shin guards under their trousers.</li>
					<li>Thigh guard, arm guards, chest guard, and elbow guards to protect the body of the batsmen. Some batsmen use these and others do not, since they reduce mobility.</li>
					<li>Gloves for batsmen only, thickly padded above the fingers and on the thumb of the hand, to protect against impact from the ball.</li>
					<li>Wicket-keeper's gloves for the wicket-keeper. Usually includes webbing between the thumb and index fingers.</li>

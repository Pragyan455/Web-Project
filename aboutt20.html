			<b><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2></b>
			<b>Twenty20 (T20)</b> is a shortened game format of cricket. At the professional level, it was introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003 for the inter-county competition. In a Twenty20 game, the two teams have a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum of 20 overs. Together with first-class and List A cricket, Twenty20 is one of the three current forms of cricket recognised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as being at the highest international or domestic level.<br><br>

			A typical Twenty20 game is completed in about three hours, with each innings lasting around 90 minutes and an official 10-minute break between the innings. This is much shorter than previous forms of the game, and is closer to the timespan of other popular team sports. It was introduced to create a fast-paced game that would be attractive to spectators at the ground and viewers on television.<br><br>

			The game has succeeded in spreading around the cricket world. On most international tours there is at least one Twenty20 match and all Test-playing nations have a domestic cup competition. West Indies are currently the defending world champions, after winning the 2016 World Cup.<br><br>

			<h2><b>HISTORY</b></h2>
			When the Benson & Hedges Cup ended in 2002, the ECB needed another one-day competition to fill its place. Cricketing authorities were looking to boost the game's popularity with the younger generation in response to dwindling crowds and reduced sponsorship. It was intended to deliver fast-paced, exciting cricket accessible to thousands of fans who were put off by the longer versions of the game. Stuart Robinson, the marketing manager of the ECB, proposed a 20-over-per-innings game to county chairmen in 2001 and they voted 11–7 in favour of adopting the new format.<br><br>

			The first official Twenty20 matches were played on 13 June 2003 between the English counties in the Twenty20 Cup.The first season of Twenty20 in England was a relative success, with the Surrey Lions defeating the Warwickshire Bears by nine wickets in the final to claim the title.The first Twenty20 match held at Lord's, on 15 July 2004 between Middlesex and Surrey, attracted a crowd of 27,509, the highest attendance for any county cricket game at the ground – other than a one-day final – since 1953.<br>

			<h2><b>TWENTY20 INTERNATIONALS</b></h2>
		    The first Twenty20 International match was held on 5 August 2004 between the England and New Zealand women's teams, with New Zealand winning by nine runs.<br><br>

			On 17 February 2005 Australia defeated New Zealand in the first men's international Twenty20 match, played at Eden Park in Auckland. The game was played in a light-hearted manner – both sides turned out in kit similar to that worn in the 1980s, the New Zealand team's a direct copy of that worn by the Beige Brigade. Some of the players also sported moustaches or beards and hairstyles popular in the 1980s, taking part in a competition amongst themselves for "best retro look", at the request of the Beige Brigade. Australia won the game comprehensively, and as the result became obvious towards the end of the NZ innings, the players and umpires took things less seriously: Glenn McGrath jokingly replayed the Trevor Chappell underarm incident from a 1981 ODI between the two sides, and Billy Bowden showed him a mock red card (red cards are not normally used in cricket) in response.<br><br>

			The first Twenty20 international in England was played between England and Australia at the Rose Bowl in Hampshire on 13 June 2005, which England won by a margin of 100 runs, a record victory which lasted until 2007.<br><br>

			<h2><b>T20 LEAGUES</b></h2>
			Several T20 leagues started after the popularity of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20.The Board of Control for Cricket in India started the Indian Premier League, which is now the largest cricket league, in 2008, which utilizes the North American sports franchise system with eight teams in major Indian cities. In September 2017, the broadcasting and digital rights for the next five years (2018–2022) of the IPL were sold to Star India for US$2.55 billion, making it one of the world's most lucrative sports league per match. The IPL has seen a spike in its brand valuation to US$5.3 billion after the 10th edition, according to global valuation and corporate finance advisor Duff & Phelps.<br><br>

			Several T20 leagues follow the general format of having a group stage followed by a Page playoff system among the top four teams where:<br><br>

		   	<li>The first- and second-highest placed teams in the group stage face off, with the winner going to the final.</li>
		   	<li>The third- and fourth-place teams face off, with the loser being eliminated.</li>
		    <li>The two teams who have not yet made it to the final after the above two matches have been played face off to fill the second berth in the final.</li><br><br>

			<h2><b>GENERAL RULES OF T20</b></h2>

			<ol type="1">
				<li>Each bowler may bowl a maximum of only one-fifth of the total overs per innings. For a full, uninterrupted match, this is four overs.</li>
		    	<li>If a bowler delivers a no-ball by overstepping the crease, it costs one run and his next delivery is designated a "free-hit". In this circumstance the batsman can only be dismissed through a run out, hitting the ball twice or obstructing the field.</li>
		   		<li> The following fielding restrictions apply:<br></li>
		   			<ul>
		       			<li>No more than five fielders can be on the leg side at any time.</li>
		       			<li>During the first six overs, a maximum of two fielders can be outside the 30-yard circle (this is known as the powerplay).</li>
		       			<li>After the first six overs, a maximum of five fielders can be outside the fielding circle.</li>
		    		</ul>
		    	<li>If the fielding team does not start to bowl their 20th over within 75 minutes, the batting side is credited an extra six runs for every whole over bowled after the 75-minute mark; the umpire may add more time to this if they believe the bowling team is wasting time.</li><br><br>
